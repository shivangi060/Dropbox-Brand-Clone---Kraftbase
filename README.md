Dropbox Brand Clone - Kraftbase

1. Next.js + TypeScript
 Next.js was chosen as the framework to leverage its built-in routing, optimized image handling, and server-side rendering features.

 TypeScript adds type safety and improves developer experience by reducing potential runtime errors.

2. Tailwind CSS
Adopted Tailwind CSS for fast, utility-first styling directly in JSX, allowing rapid prototyping and consistent design patterns.

It provides flexibility when working with responsive layouts and custom grid areas.

3. Framer Motion
Used Framer Motion for smooth and declarative animations:

Navbar fades and slides in on load.

AssetGrid items animate in staggered sequence when they enter the viewport.

Hover states for grid items include scale, rotate, and color transition effects.

Scroll-to-top button fades in/out based on scroll position and has hover animations.

4. Lenis Smooth Scrolling
Integrated Lenis for smooth and inertia-based scrolling.

Enhances the user experience by making scroll interactions feel more fluid across the entire layout.

5. Modular Component Structure
Navbar.tsx: A fixed, animated navigation bar for branding and quick links.

AssetGrid.tsx: A dynamic grid of brand sections with interactive icons and custom grid area layout using CSS Grid.

SmoothScrollProvider.tsx: Global provider for applying Lenis to all pages.

page.tsx: Combines all components and defines full-screen section anchors for each brand guideline (e.g., Logo, Typography, Motion).

6. Interactive Asset Grid
The grid items are configured using an assets array to map icons, colors, and target sections.

Each grid item:

Animates into view using useInView and useAnimation from Framer Motion.

Supports hover state icon swaps and background transitions.

Smooth scrolls to corresponding sections using native scrollIntoView.

7. Scroll-to-Top Button
A floating button appears after scrolling 300px down the page.

Animated with Framer Motion for smooth entry/exit and hover scale.

Uses native window.scrollTo with smooth behavior for quick UX improvement.

8. Accessibility & UX
All buttons and interactive elements have sufficient contrast.

Smooth scroll actions provide a better visual transition between sections.

Icons are paired with semantic section titles for clarity.

9. Custom Grid Layout
The grid areas in AssetGrid use grid-template-areas to create a visually interesting and asymmetric layout inspired by modern design systems.

Optimized for both desktop and responsive views with Tailwind utilities.
